SpreeWarehouse
==============

Warehouse is an extension for Spree that will extend Spree into a full warehouse system, including an Android (and possibly iOS) client for inter-warehouse management using QR codes and bar-codes.
Please see the design document (still a work in progress) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-C33WjH5GooNKW-GsW7-Ol_K4-7PbwVxPk3Vs2MmO0/edit).

Installation
=======

After including `spree_warehouse` in your Gemfile and bundling run:  
`rake spree_warehouse:install:migrations`  
`rake db:migrate`


Testing
-------

Run `rake test_app` to generate the test_app.
Then run rake to run the features and spec tests.

If you have problems try prefixing things with 'bundle exec '.
